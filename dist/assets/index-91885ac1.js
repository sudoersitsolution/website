It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among infants under the age of five and the elderly. According to WHO1, 1.4 million pneumonia-related fatalities among children under five in 2018. Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, as it can reveal important symptoms, such as increased lung opacity and consolidation. However, it can be difficult to interpret a chest X-ray (CXR) because pneumonia symptoms can be subtle and overlap with other lung diseases. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is essential for expediting treatment and improving patient outcomes. Radiological images, such as chest X-rays or CT scans, require specialized training and can be time-consuming to diagnose pneumonia.In recent years, there has been significant interest to develop model using machine learning techniques that assist physicians in diagnosing pneumonia using chest X-ray images. These techniques have shown promising results and may improve the efficacy and accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis."},{title:"Parkinson’s Detection System using Python",description:"Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness.
